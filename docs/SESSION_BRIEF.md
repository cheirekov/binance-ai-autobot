Use this file at the start and end of every batch.

## 1) Batch contract (fill before coding)

- Batch type: `SHORT (1-3h)`
- Active ticket: `T-031` (Regime engine v2)
- Linked support ticket: `T-032` (bounded downside-control support)
- Goal (single sentence): stop `CAUTION`/risk-budget defensive mode from repeatedly selecting dust residuals where both grid legs are blocked.
- In scope:
  - keep `T-031` active as the strategy-quality lane.
  - route new exposure, grid BUYs, market entries, and fee/edge checks through `deriveRiskBudgetDecision`.
  - respect `GRID_SELL_NOT_ACTIONABLE` cooldowns for dust home-quote symbols during non-`NORMAL` risk states when the BUY leg is also paused.
  - keep recovered quote protected against immediate BUY re-spend after no-feasible recovery sells.
  - keep profit-giveback `CAUTION` as a fresh-entry freeze while giveback remains above the caution threshold or daily realized PnL is negative.
  - preserve the May 7 managed-position lock bypass so existing inventory remains reachable for exit/unwind handling.
  - keep daily-loss/profit-giveback fee-aware guardrails from the May 4 slice.
  - preserve the April 30 dust/zero SELL-leg BUY progression behavior.
  - preserve the April 28 dust-storm bypass, April 27 recovery dust parking, April 23/20 quote quarantine behavior, and April 15 fee-edge quarantine.
  - preserve April 20 exposure clipping plus April 12 and March 30-31 `T-032` downside-control behavior.
  - preserve `T-034` funding / quote-routing stability.
- Out of scope:
  - quote-routing redesign (`T-034` stays closed unless runtime regresses),
  - promoting `T-032` to the active ticket beyond this bounded support fix,
  - weakening entry filters or fee-edge floors,
  - AI lane/promotion work (`T-025+`),
  - futures/margin execution,
  - news/event action-driving,
  - PnL schema/reporting rewrites (`T-007` is closed),
  - endpoint/auth/UI redesign.
- Hypothesis: the risk-budget patch is deployed and blocking new exposure, but the managed-risk bypass still reselects SAGA dust after a sell-leg cooldown even though live free quantity is below `minQty` and BUY is paused by caution/risk budget.
- Target KPI delta:
  - `riskBudget` continues appearing in relevant skip details for new-exposure, GRID BUY, MARKET entry, and fee/edge decisions.
  - repeated `Skip SAGAUSDC: Grid sell leg not actionable yet` drops materially after the cooldown is respected.
  - no immediate BUY re-spend of quote recovered by `no-feasible-liquidity-recovery` sells.
  - no fresh grid BUY reopen cycle while `trigger=PROFIT_GIVEBACK` and `state=CAUTION/HALT`.
  - high risk still respects defensive/reduce-only behavior in `HALT`, confirmed bear, and active loss/giveback `CAUTION`.
  - `RECOVERY_OPPORTUNITY` appears only after caution has stabilized and exposure is near-flat.
  - managed sell/unwind/exit evaluation remains visible for existing exposure.
  - lower churn/fee pressure after liquidity recovery.
  - preserve fee-aware daily-loss/profit-giveback and April 30 BUY progression behavior.
- Stop/rollback condition:
  - if the patch blocks actionable managed exits/unwinds, weakens hard risk locks, allows recovery-sell → immediate BUY churn, or makes risk 100 bypass fee-proof edge, reopen PM/BA triage immediately.

## 2) Definition of Done (must be concrete)

- API behavior:
  - runtime behavior changes in a bounded way:
    - all new exposure gates use `apps/api/src/modules/bot/risk-budget.service.ts`.
    - dust home-quote `GRID_SELL_NOT_ACTIONABLE` cooldowns are respected in `CAUTION`/`HALT` when the BUY leg is also paused.
    - high risk no longer lowers fee-edge requirements below estimated round-trip cost.
    - `HALT`, confirmed bear, and active negative `CAUTION` become defensive/reduce-only for new exposure.
    - stabilized `CAUTION` can permit only small recovery-opportunity exposure.
    - after `no-feasible-liquidity-recovery`, BUY sizing temporarily preserves the high quote reserve instead of only the hard reserve.
    - reserve rebuild skips are not treated as pressure to trigger another recovery sell.
    - countable managed positions can bypass non-hard recovery/min-order/max-position/grid-sell cooldown locks during daily-loss `CAUTION`/`HALT`.
    - fresh candidates still respect those cooldown locks.
    - profit-giveback `CAUTION` pauses fresh symbols while giveback remains above the caution threshold.
    - profit-giveback `CAUTION` pauses fresh symbols while daily realized PnL is negative.
    - daily-loss/profit-giveback closed PnL remains fee-aware.
    - severe near-halt daily-loss `CAUTION` still pauses fresh symbols even when managed exposure is near-flat.
    - April 30 dust/zero SELL legs still do not block reachable grid BUY legs.
    - `GRID_SELL_NOT_ACTIONABLE` storm-lock behavior from April 28 remains preserved.
    - below-minimum recovery sell candidates receive a multi-hour symbol-level `NO_FEASIBLE_RECOVERY_MIN_ORDER` cooldown.
    - home-quote / actionable sell-leg candidates remain reachable.
    - April 20 linked-support `T-032` exposure fix remains preserved.
    - April 17 no-feasible dust cooldown remains preserved.
    - April 15 global fee-edge quarantine behavior remains preserved.
    - April 13-15 residual storm behavior remains preserved.
    - April 12 `ABS_DAILY_LOSS` `CAUTION` thaw remains preserved.
    - March 30-31 `T-032` caution-unwind / thaw behavior remains preserved.
  - active development lane is `T-031`; `T-032` remains preserved as a support lane in runtime.
- Runtime evidence in decisions/logs:
  - latest fresh bundle before this patch runs `git.commit=ca13c42`.
  - latest fresh bundle (`autobot-feedback-20260514-103746.tgz`) shows:
    - `risk_state=CAUTION`
    - `trigger=PROFIT_GIVEBACK`
    - `daily_net_usdt=14.08`
    - `max_drawdown_pct=2.78009`
    - `open_positions=8`
    - `total_alloc_pct=0.32`
    - top loop `Skip SAGAUSDC: Grid sell leg not actionable yet (48)`.
  - next fresh bundle after this patch should show lower SAGA dust sell-leg churn while `riskBudget` still blocks fresh exposure in active profit-giveback caution.
- Risk slider impact:
  - risk slider now feeds a deterministic budget contract instead of only widening exposure/turnover.
  - risk-state protections remain hard; high risk cannot bypass `HALT`, confirmed bear defense, active negative `CAUTION`, or fee-proof edge.
- Validation commands:
  - `(cd apps/api && ./node_modules/.bin/vitest run src/modules/bot/risk-budget.service.test.ts --cache=false)`
  - `(cd apps/api && ./node_modules/.bin/vitest run src/modules/bot/bot-engine.service.test.ts -t "dust sell-leg|grid-sell-not-actionable|managed daily-loss candidates" --cache=false)`
  - `(cd apps/api && ./node_modules/.bin/vitest run src/modules/bot/bot-engine.service.test.ts --cache=false)`
  - `(cd apps/api && ./node_modules/.bin/vitest run --cache=false)`
  - `./apps/api/node_modules/.bin/tsc -p apps/api/tsconfig.json --noEmit`
  - `./scripts/validate-active-ticket.sh`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `./scripts/pmba-gate.sh start`
  - `./scripts/pmba-gate.sh end`
- Runtime validation plan:
  - deploy the current `T-031` slice and collect one fresh bundle before any further reprioritization

Out of scope: quote-routing redesign, futures/margin, news/event action-driving, PnL schema changes, AI lane.
Validation: ./scripts/validate-active-ticket.sh && ./scripts/pmba-gate.sh end
After next bundle: check SAGA sell-leg-not-actionable count drops and riskBudget still blocks fresh BUYs during profit-giveback CAUTION.
